##### CREATED EXCLUSIVELY BY NOUVEAU LASHES, LVL ENHANCE IS THE REVOLUTIONARY NATURAL LASH TREATMENT TAKING THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY BY STORM.

The treatment straightens your natural eyelashes at the root, so unlike a traditional lash perm it creates the effect of longer, lifted lashes in just 40 minutes. They'll stay that way for six to eight weeks, especially when you nurture your lashes with our exclusive [Nouveau Lashes Conditioning Serum][0]. The results are immediate, plus the added lash tint creates a mascara-type effect so you are always ready to go.

### _HOW DOES IT WORK?_

Unlike a traditional lash perm, LVL Enhance straightens your natural lashes at the root, creating the appearance of longer, thicker lashes. Plus the added lash tint creates a mascara-style effect, so your lashes are perfect from the moment you wake up. No extensions, no adhesive and no need for mascara! 

### _HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?_

Ideal for those seeking a more natural look, the treatment takes just 40 minutes but the effects are instant. Indulge in this relaxing treatment by visiting one of our trained LVL lash technicians who will provide you with a comfortable set-up in a relaxing environment and perform a closed-eye procedure while you unwind.

### _HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?_

Your natural lashes will promote the benefit of LVL Enhance for up to 6-8 weeks. Little maintenance is required once you leave the salon. What's more, by combining the treatment with regular use of our unique Nouveau Lashes [Conditioning Serum][0] to nourish your lashes, you could be about to say goodbye to mascara for good!
